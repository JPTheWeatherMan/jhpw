# JHPW

JHPW is a personal website made with the Monokai syntax highlighting color scheme in mind as well as a dark theme based on VSCode's Material Theme Darker.

Information is fetched from JSON files under `src/db/`, so it is functional as a template as long as the JSON files are formatted correctly.

## Technologies

JHPW was built with React, TypeScript, Material-UI, and React Router. Deployed using Netlify.

## Future features

- implement responsiveness
